    <h2>Jamesfoxbr's Terms of Service for Digital Art Commissions</h2>

    <br>

    <h3>Regarding payment and waiting list:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>
                The prices are in USD (United State Dollars). 
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                Please don’t send the payment if I haven’t yet confirmed your commission and asked for the payment. When the time comes in the commission waiting list I will inform you before send a invoice. 
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                I only ask for payment when I will start to work in the commission. I don't ask any payment to add you to the commission waiting list and you are free to ask me to remove you from the waiting list if you change your mind.  
            </p>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>I accept and don't accept to draw:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>
                You can ask me for examples of drawings when contact and I will send links of my galleries if you need more examples. You can find some of my galleries links in my Contact Page. 
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                The best way to know what type of drawing I accept is send me a email asking me about what you have in mind. I will gladly answer any question necessary about the commission ( jamesfoxbr@hotmail.com ).
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                I have the right to not accept something I don't feel comfortable to draw.

    <h3>About Shipping:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>
                You are buying digital goods, what means nothing physical will be shipped.
            </p>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Commission Process:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>
                If you ask I can show you the drawing at each stage of the process (I always sketch it before I start to paint). You can ask me to make corrections and necessary minor changes during the drawing process (big changes in the pose or lines are only possible in the early stages or will need extra payment for the long time it takes in final stages of the paint). For this reason keep in mind the right choices and character details.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                If you don't have any visual references (pictures or ref sheet) I will need a detailed description of the character's appearance to draw for the first time
            </p>
        </li>
    </ul>
