    <h2>Stuff I like to do:</h2>
    <p>
        <b>Sketch/draw/paint:</b> I like to draw several different subjects, but most of time I draw anthro characters, but I can draw anything when I need like cars, houses, objects, landscapes, tools, mech, etc. I love make pixeart too!
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Play videogames: I like a ton of different game genres, but I think my favorite genre are sandbox games. I prefer play indie games instead AAA games. I'm trying to learn how to make games too. I started making some simple prototypes on Pico-8, after this I jumped and started to learn Godot and now I'm learning programming using C++ to try to make a game without game engine.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        <b>Worldbuilding:</b> I like to create worlds and characters and sometimes I draw it when I have some extra time time. Most people don't know but I have some hundreds of characters and places I created during several years. I really wish I have some extra time to draw or write about all this stuff. I have two world I created. One is Called The Broken Elements and is a Steampunk world in a alternative different planet called Erde where all people are anthropomorphic animals. The other world I created is called Tesseract Universe  and is a sci-fi universe with space travel and almost all this space faring famous tropes.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        <b>Play Tabletop RPG:</b> I played for tabletop RPG several years in the past, but recently I'm not much look with this stuff. Some of the Tabletop RPG systems I played in my favorite order: Gurps (3rd and 4th edition), Fate (Core edition, and Mindjammer version), Traveller Mongoose 1st and 2nd edition, Cyberpunk 2020 (This one I just played the setting but used Gurps 4th system), Dungeons & Dragons 3e, 3.5e, 5e and a ton of other minor systems I don't wish to extend this list.
